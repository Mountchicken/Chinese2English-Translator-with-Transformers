# Chinese2English-Translator-with-Transformers
- Hello guysüòÑ, hope you are doing awesome
- In this repository, I Improved my previous chinese2english translator with transformer and it do get a tremendous improvement

# Examples
- Here are some translating examples, this model has a great accurancy on the training data(overfittingüò•), and 
- it seems to work bad on test data. I think its the problem of datasets because i only used the validation dataset
- of translation2019zh, which is quite small. But, you know that, i do this just for funüòÅ. Anyway, if i want and 
- i have time, i will train a really useful chinese2english translator

- `train.py`: Train the model
- `model.py`: Define the model
- `inference.py`:Translate your own chinese sentece to english one !!
## Folders
- 'saved_vocab`: Contain serval vocabulary txt and you can also generate then during training
- `translation2019zh`: This is Google's chinese2english translation samples. It's huge and i only take the validation dataset to train
